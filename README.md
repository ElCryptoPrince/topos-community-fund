## :sparkles: Introduction
Welcome to the **Topos Community Fund**, a unique initiative designed to support projects that deliver a positive impact on the Topos ecosystem. This program aims not only to provide financial assistance to innovative projects but also to enhance community engagement, visibility, and recognition within the Topos network.

## :dart: Goal
Our goal is to foster a vibrant and innovative community by empowering project owners through funding, resources, and a platform to showcase their projects.

## :page_with_curl: Grant Flow

1. **Proposal Submission**: Project owners submit their grant proposals with budget requests via GitHub.
2. **Panel Review**: A collaborative session between Toposware employees and community members on Discord to select projects for community voting.
3. **Community Voting**: Projects pitch their ideas in a public session on Discord, followed by a community vote.
4. **Funding Allocation**: Funds are distributed based on vote counts until the budget is exhausted. Any remainder rolls over to the next round.

To apply, submit your project proposal as an issue in this repository. Detailed guidelines are available [here](link-to-submission-guide).

## ðŸ’² Payment

Grants will be awarded over two payment milestones. Grant Recipients submit a payment milestone issue through GitHub and a form. For the payment to be unlocked, milestone submissions will need to be accepted by Toposware Inc.

* Milestone 1 is for 20% of the grant payment, and submission is one week after the project kick-off.
* Milestone 2 is for the remaining 80% of the grant payment and is expected to be submitted at the end of the project timeline (from three to ten weeks, depending on the agreed timeline for the project).

Find out more about the Milestones here: [Milestone Guide](./milestone_guide.md)
